## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 

Very interesting idea for a project! As I mentioned in class, my only concern is the usage of the Twitter API and ensuring you are getting enough data to perform your analysis. Another group found this Python package:

That might be useful in getting the data necessary for your analysis. Overall this looks good and keep going!
